### 8.5 Animation Performance Guidelines

**Best Practices to Follow:**
1. Use `transform` and `opacity` only (GPU-accelerated)
2. Add `will-change` hints for complex animations
3. Support `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
4. Lazy load particle systems
5. Limit concurrent animations to 3-4
6. Use `requestAnimationFrame` for scroll effects
7. Test on low-end mobile devices

**Example Reduced Motion Support:**
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

| Celebration | #FBBF24 (Gold) | Points, rewards, streaks |
