# Solution Guide - The Sunrise Canteen Caper
**For Teachers Only**

## The Culprit
**Alex** (Student Helper) took the $50.

## Evidence Summary

### Math Evidence
- **Friday's Sales:** 
  - Lunch: $180.50
  - Recess: $95.80
  - **Total Expected:** $276.30

- **Monday's Count:**
  - Cash found: $226.30
  - **Difference:** $50.00 missing

### Timeline Evidence
- **Friday 5:00 PM:** Mrs. Tan counts cash ($276.30) and locks strongbox
- **Friday 5:15 PM:** Mr. Lim cleans main area (never enters storage room)
- **Friday 5:30 PM:** Miss Chen retrieves science supplies (witnessed by Mr. Lim)
- **Friday 5:45 PM:** Alex enters through back door (security log shows entry)
- **Friday 6:00 PM:** School locks up for weekend

### Physical Evidence
1. **Security Log:** Alex signed in at 5:45 PM (last person with access)
2. **Calculator Fingerprints:** Match Alex's fingerprints
3. **Hidden Backpack:** Found behind shelf with exactly $50 inside
4. **Lock Status:** Strongbox lock NOT forced - someone knew combination

### Suspect Analysis

#### Mr. Lim (Innocent)
- **Alibi:** Cleaned main canteen area only, left at 5:25 PM
- **Verified by:** Miss Chen saw him leaving
- **No motive:** Has no access to strongbox combination
- **Physical evidence:** No fingerprints on calculator

#### Miss Chen (Innocent)
- **Alibi:** Retrieved lab supplies at 5:30 PM, left at 5:35 PM
- **Verified by:** Mr. Lim saw her arrive and leave
- **No access:** Never went near cash register area
- **Physical evidence:** No connection to hidden backpack

#### Alex (Guilty)
- **Timeline:** Entered at 5:45 PM (after everyone else left)
- **Access:** As student helper, knows strongbox combination
- **Physical evidence:**
  - Fingerprints on calculator (used to recount money)
  - Backpack with exact missing amount ($50)
  - Security log shows solo entry with no witness
- **Motive:** Needed money (mentioned wanting new shoes in interview)
- **Behavior:** Nervous during interview, avoided eye contact

## How Students Should Solve It

### Step 1: Calculate the Missing Amount
Students use Friday's receipt:
- Lunch sales: $180.50
- Recess sales: $95.80
- Total: $180.50 + $95.80 = $276.30

Monday's count shows: $226.30
Difference: $276.30 - $226.30 = **$50.00 missing**

### Step 2: Analyze Timeline
Create timeline from security log and interviews:
```
5:00 PM - Mrs. Tan locks strongbox
5:15 PM - Mr. Lim cleaning (leaves 5:25 PM)
5:30 PM - Miss Chen gets supplies (leaves 5:35 PM)
5:45 PM - Alex enters (no witness)
6:00 PM - School locked
```

**Key insight:** Only Alex had unsupervised access after 5:35 PM

### Step 3: Match Physical Evidence
- Calculator fingerprints → Alex
- Hidden backpack → Found where Alex has access
- Amount in backpack → Exactly $50 (the missing amount)

### Step 4: Eliminate Suspects
- Mr. Lim: No access to strongbox, witnessed leaving early
- Miss Chen: Never near cash area, alibi verified
- Alex: Solo access + physical evidence + exact amount

### Step 5: Make Accusation
Students must present:
1. Math proof ($50 missing)
2. Timeline showing Alex's opportunity
3. Physical evidence (fingerprints + backpack)
4. Lack of alibi (no one saw Alex after 5:45 PM)

## Learning Outcomes Achieved

### Mathematics (Primary Focus)
✅ Addition with decimals (calculating total sales)
✅ Subtraction with money ($276.30 - $226.30)
✅ Comparing amounts
✅ Reading and interpreting receipts

### Critical Thinking
✅ Analyzing timelines
✅ Evaluating alibis
✅ Logical deduction (process of elimination)
✅ Connecting evidence to conclusion

### Real-World Skills
✅ Understanding financial records
✅ Time management concepts
✅ Integrity and consequences
✅ Evidence-based reasoning

## Common Student Mistakes

1. **Calculation Error:** Adding $180.50 + $95.80 incorrectly
   - **Fix:** Encourage students to show their work step-by-step

2. **Jumping to Conclusions:** Accusing someone without evidence
   - **Fix:** Require students to list 3+ pieces of evidence

3. **Ignoring Timeline:** Not noticing Alex was alone
   - **Fix:** Have students draw a timeline diagram

4. **Missing the Backpack:** Not searching storage room thoroughly
   - **Fix:** Emphasize clicking on all interactive elements

## Extension Activities

### For Advanced Students
- Calculate what percentage of total sales is missing (50/276.30 ≈ 18%)
- Estimate how long it took to count and take the money
- Write a "court case" presenting all evidence

### For Struggling Students
- Provide calculator for initial math
- Give hints about which clues connect
- Simplified version: Only 2 suspects to consider

## Assessment Rubric

| Criterion | Exemplary (4) | Proficient (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Math Accuracy | Correct calculation with work shown | Correct answer, minor errors in process | Incorrect answer, attempted work | No attempt at calculation |
| Evidence Collection | Found all 7 clues | Found 5-6 clues | Found 3-4 clues | Found 0-2 clues |
| Logical Reasoning | Clear explanation linking all evidence | Good reasoning, minor gaps | Some connections made | No clear reasoning |
| Conclusion | Correct culprit with full justification | Correct culprit, partial justification | Incorrect culprit, attempted reasoning | No conclusion or random guess |

## Teacher Tips

1. **Time Management:** Most students need 25-35 minutes
2. **Group Work:** Can be done in pairs for peer discussion
3. **Scaffolding:** Provide hint system for students who get stuck
4. **Reflection:** Ask students to explain their solving process after completion
5. **Real-World Connection:** Discuss importance of honesty and consequences
