# The Sunrise Canteen Caper

## 📋 Case Briefing

It's a typical Monday morning at Sunrise Primary School. Mrs. Tan, the canteen manager, arrives early to prepare for the school day.

But something is very wrong.

After counting the cash inside the canteen strongbox, Mrs. Tan realises that the amount does NOT match the sales records from Friday. When she re-checks her calculations, she confirms the shocking truth:

**$50 is missing.**

On Friday, the canteen had a busy lunch and recess rush. All money was counted, recorded on receipts, and locked away before the weekend. The strongbox was supposed to be secure — but someone must have accessed it when no one was watching.

Only **THREE people** were anywhere near the canteen after school hours:

- **Mr. Lim** - The cleaner
- **Miss Chen** - The science teacher
- **Alex** - A student helper

Each claims to have been there for innocent reasons. Each insists they did nothing wrong.

Yet the numbers do not add up.
