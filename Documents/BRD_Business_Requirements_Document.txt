## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview

The Detective Learning Game is an innovative educational web platform designed to enhance Mathematics and Science mastery for Singapore Primary School students (Primary 4-6) through interactive detective-themed case mysteries. Starting with Mathematics (Phase 1), expanding to Science (Phase 2), the platform aligns with the Ministry of Education (MOE) syllabus and prepares students for PSLE examinations through engaging, game-based learning.

### 8.2 Detailed Risk Analysis

#### R-001: Schools Decline Pilot Participation

**Likelihood:** Medium (40%)  
**Impact:** High (blocks validation)

**Causes:**
- Schools overwhelmed with EdTech requests
- Lack of time during school year
- Skepticism about effectiveness
- Budget constraints (even if free)

**Mitigation:**
- **Proactive:** Target 20+ schools (expect 15-30% conversion)
- **Proactive:** Reach out during school holidays (less busy)
- **Proactive:** Provide one-pagers showing pilot benefits
- **Reactive:** Offer to run pilot during enrichment weeks (less curriculum pressure)
- **Reactive:** Get testimonial from first pilot school to attract others

**Contingency Plan:**
- If <3 schools by Month 2, pivot to individual teacher pilots (not whole-school)
- Offer to integrate with existing after-school programs

#### R-003: No Measurable Learning Improvement

**Likelihood:** Low (15%)  
**Impact:** Critical (undermines entire value proposition)

**Causes:**
- Cases not aligned with skills tested in exams
- Students treat it as "just a game" (no transfer of learning)
- Sample size too small for statistical significance
- External factors (tuition, parental support) confound results

**Mitigation:**
- **Proactive:** Validate case content with 2+ experienced MOE teachers
- **Proactive:** Map every quiz question to specific PSLE question types
- **Proactive:** Use control group design (pilot class vs non-pilot class)
- **Proactive:** Pre-test students to establish baseline
- **Reactive:** Iterate cases based on pilot data (which questions students struggle with)
- **Reactive:** Add explicit "learning links" showing connection to exams

**Contingency Plan:**
- If no improvement after Pilot Phase 1 (3 months), conduct in-depth analysis:
  - Which skills showed no improvement? (redesign those cases)
  - Which students improved vs didn't? (segment and personalize)
- Extend pilot by 3 months with revised cases

#### R-004: PDPA Compliance Breach

**Likelihood:** Low (10%)  
**Impact:** Critical (legal liability, reputation damage)

**Causes:**
- Data stored on non-Singapore servers
- Unauthorized access to student data
- Insufficient consent mechanisms
- Data not deleted per retention policy

**Mitigation:**
- **Proactive:** Legal review of data practices before pilot
- **Proactive:** Use Singapore-based AWS (ap-southeast-1 region only)
- **Proactive:** Implement row-level security in database
- **Proactive:** Annual third-party security audit
- **Proactive:** Clear parent consent forms (reviewed by lawyer)
- **Reactive:** Incident response plan (notify affected parties within 72 hours)
- **Reactive:** Cyber insurance policy

**Contingency Plan:**
- If breach occurs:
  - Immediately isolate affected systems
  - Notify PDPC (Personal Data Protection Commission) within 72 hours
  - Offer credit monitoring to affected users
  - Publish transparent post-mortem

#### R-006: MOE Approval Delayed/Rejected

**Likelihood:** Medium (30%)  
**Impact:** High (delays scale, limits school adoption)

**Causes:**
- Lengthy bureaucratic process
- Insufficient evidence of effectiveness
- Concerns about data privacy
- Competing priorities at MOE

**Mitigation:**
- **Proactive:** Engage MOE early (Month 3) to understand requirements
- **Proactive:** Build strong pilot data showing learning outcomes
- **Proactive:** Align with existing MOE initiatives (e.g., EdTech Plan)
- **Proactive:** Get endorsement from respected educators (principals, HODs)
- **Reactive:** Apply for interim approval to continue pilot while awaiting full approval
- **Reactive:** Offer to conduct MOE-supervised trial

**Contingency Plan:**
- If approval takes >12 months:
  - Continue growing via school-by-school partnerships (doesn't require MOE approval)
  - Focus on private/international schools (different regulatory path)
  - Explore alternative markets (Malaysia, Brunei)

#### R-007: Budget Overrun (Free Tier Limits Exceeded)

**Likelihood:** High (60%)  
**Impact:** Medium (requires funding earlier than planned)

**Causes:**
- Faster user growth than expected (good problem!)
- Underestimated database/storage usage
- Free tier caps hit (Vercel, Supabase)

**Mitigation:**
- **Proactive:** Set up usage monitoring and alerts (70% threshold)
- **Proactive:** Apply for MOE EdTech grant in Month 4 (before limits hit)
- **Proactive:** Implement caching aggressively to reduce database queries
- **Proactive:** Optimize images and assets to reduce storage
- **Reactive:** Negotiate extended free tier with providers (as educational project)
- **Reactive:** Crowdfunding or angel investment if needed

**Contingency Plan:**
- If budget needed urgently:
  - Pause new school onboarding temporarily
  - Prioritize existing users (don't break current experience)
  - Seek emergency grant from Education-focused VCs (EdVentures, SGInnovate)

### 10.3 Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Dependencies (Must Complete On Time):**

1. **Case 1 Completion (Month 2)** → Blocks pilot kickoff
2. **Pilot School Recruitment (Month 3)** → Blocks validation
3. **Pilot Data Collection (Month 5-6)** → Blocks MOE submission
4. **MOE Submission (Month 7)** → Blocks grant funding

**Slack Time (Can Be Delayed Without Major Impact):**

- Parent portal (not needed for pilot)
- Multilingual support (English sufficient for MVP)
- Achievement badges (nice-to-have)
- AI hints (manual teacher support can substitute)

### 10.4 Risk Buffer

**Contingency Time Built In:**
- 20% buffer for each major milestone
- If pilot recruitment delayed 2 weeks → still on track for Month 4 kickoff
- If MOE approval takes 18 months (not 12) → can continue growing via direct school sales

### 12.4 Design Guidelines & Standards

#### 12.4.1 Visual Design System

**Color Palette:**
- **Primary (Detective Blue):** #3498DB - Navigation, CTAs, headers
- **Secondary (Clue Yellow):** #F39C12 - Highlights, badges, stars
- **Success Green:** #27AE60 - Correct answers, progress bars
- **Error Red:** #E74C3C - Incorrect answers, warnings (used sparingly)
- **Neutral Gray:** #95A5A6 - Secondary text, borders
- **Background:** #F8F9FA - Light, easy on eyes for long reading sessions

**Typography:**
- **Headings:** Poppins (friendly, rounded, clear at all sizes)
- **Body Text:** Open Sans (high readability, WCAG-compliant at 16px+)
- **Minimum Size:** 16px body, 18px for struggling readers mode
- **Line Spacing:** 1.5-1.6 for paragraphs (aids reading comprehension)

**Iconography:**
- Custom icon set: Friendly, detective-themed (magnifying glass, badge, clues)
- All icons paired with text labels (avoid icon-only navigation)
- Size: 24x24px minimum for touch targets

**Imagery:**
- Illustrated style (not realistic) - warm, inclusive, age-appropriate
- Diverse character representation: Singapore's multicultural society (Chinese, Malay, Indian, Eurasian)
- No violent or scary visuals (even in "mystery" context)

---

#### 12.4.2 Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Visual Accessibility:**
- Contrast Ratios: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Colorblind-Friendly: Never rely on color alone (use icons + text)
- Zoom: Interface usable up to 200% zoom without horizontal scrolling
- Font Scaling: Respect browser/OS text size preferences

**Interaction Accessibility:**
- Keyboard Navigation: All features accessible via Tab/Enter/Arrow keys
- Focus Indicators: Visible, high-contrast focus outlines (3px solid)
- Touch Targets: Minimum 44x44px (mobile), 10px spacing between
- Error Prevention: Confirm before deleting progress or leaving incomplete cases

**Cognitive Accessibility:**
- Simple Language: Grade 4-5 reading level for instructions
- Progress Indicators: Always show where user is in multi-step flows
- Undo Options: Allow students to go back and review previous questions
- Consistent Layout: Navigation, buttons in same place across all pages

**Assistive Technology:**
- Screen Reader Support: Semantic HTML5, ARIA labels where needed
- Alt Text: Descriptive text for all images and clue visuals
- Audio Narration: Optional text-to-speech for case narratives (dyslexia support)
- Captions: All video/audio content has captions

**Neurodiversity Support:**
- Focus Mode: Option to reduce animations, remove distractions
- Flexible Timing: No strict time limits on questions (anxiety reduction)
- Break Reminders: Suggest breaks after 15 minutes of continuous play
- Dyslexia-Friendly Font: OpenDyslexic font option in settings

---

#### 12.4.3 Mobile Responsiveness

**Breakpoints:**
- Desktop: 1200px+ (Full dashboard, side-by-side layouts)
- Tablet: 768px-1199px (Stacked cards, condensed navigation)
- Mobile: 320px-767px (Single column, hamburger menu, larger buttons)

**Mobile-First Considerations:**
- Primary Use Case: Students on school tablets or home devices
- Touch Gestures: Swipe between case scenes, tap to reveal clues
- Offline Mode: Download cases for offline play (future feature)
- Data Usage: Optimized images (<200KB), lazy loading

---

### 12.5 Feedback Loops & Continuous Improvement

#### 12.5.1 User Feedback Collection

**In-App Feedback Mechanisms:**
1. **Emoji Ratings:** After each case - "How fun was this?" 😊😐😞
2. **Quick Surveys:** Random 1-question pop-ups (10% of users)
   - "Was this question too easy, just right, or too hard?"
3. **Teacher Feedback Form:** Monthly prompt to complete short survey
4. **Parent Feedback:** Email survey after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months
5. **Student Focus Groups:** Quarterly sessions with 8-10 students (pilot schools)

**Feedback Channels:**

- WhatsApp: +65 XXXX-XXXX (Teacher/Parent support)
- In-App Chat: Live chat during school hours (9am-3pm SGT)
- Community Forum: Teachers share best practices (moderated)

---

#### 12.5.2 Design Iteration Process

**Quarterly Design Review Cycle:**

**Month 1: Data Collection**
- Analytics: Heatmaps, user flows, bounce rates, completion rates
- Support Tickets: Categorize common issues (technical vs UX)
- Survey Responses: Aggregate satisfaction scores, pain points

**Month 2: Analysis & Ideation**
- UX Team: Identify top 3 friction points
- Teacher Advisory Board: Validate proposed changes
- Competitor Analysis: Scan for new EdTech UX trends

**Month 3: Prototype & Test**
- Create mockups (Figma) for proposed changes
- User Testing: 5-8 students + 2 teachers test prototypes
- A/B Testing: Deploy changes to 10% of users first
- Measure Impact: Compare metrics (completion rate, satisfaction)

**Month 4: Deploy & Document**
- Full rollout if A/B test successful
- Update design system documentation
- Notify users of improvements in release notes

**Example Past Iterations:**
- **Issue Found:** 30% of students skipped tutorial
- **Solution:** Made tutorial interactive mini-case instead of slides
- **Result:** Tutorial completion increased to 85%
