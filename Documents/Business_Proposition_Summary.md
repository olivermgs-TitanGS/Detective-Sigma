# Detective Sigma

---

*"The suspect left a receipt. It shows 3/4 of the students bought lunch. There are 32 students in class. How much money should be in the cashier box?"*

*Your move, Detective.*

---

**What if Math class felt like this every day?**

Not worksheets. Not drilling. Not "do 50 questions for homework."

Stories. Mysteries. Clues that need Math to decode.

**Detective Sigma** — where Singapore Primary 4-6 students solve cases using PSLE Math and Science.

---

## The Truth About Math Class

*"Do pages 23-47. Show your working. Due tomorrow."*

Repeat 100 times. That's Primary school Math.

Kids aren't stupid. They know this is boring. We know this is boring. We just don't know what else to do.

So they drill. And forget. And drill again.

**What if Math felt like solving a puzzle they actually cared about?**

Not "because exam."
Not "because teacher said."

Because they want to know what happens next in the story.

---

**The Hidden Reality:**
- Worksheets don't stick. Kids memorize for PSLE, forget by Secondary 1.
- Tuition works but costs $200-400/month (only 60% of families can afford it).
- Schools want better tools but have zero budget and zero time for complicated platforms.
- Parents want to help but don't remember MOE methods taught today.

## How It Works (The Experience)

**Imagine this:**

Your student opens their laptop. No worksheets. No "Do Exercise 3.2."

They see: *"Case #3: The Missing Canteen Money. $120 disappeared. Three suspects. You have 45 minutes."*

They click START.

---

**Scene 1: The Canteen**

*"Auntie at the counter says 3/4 of the students bought lunch today. There are 32 students in Primary 5B. Each meal costs $2.50."*

**Clue unlocked:** A blurry receipt.

They need to calculate: How much money SHOULD be in the box?

This isn't "Question 14, Page 32." This is **evidence**.

They solve it. They get a number. That number matters because it tells them how much was stolen.

---

**Scene 2: The Classroom**

*"Witness says they saw someone near the canteen at 2:45pm. But the theft happened at 1:15pm. How long between theft and sighting?"*

Time calculation. Elapsed time. Duration.

It's all P5 Math syllabus. But they're not thinking about syllabus. They're thinking: *"Was there enough time for the suspect to hide the money?"*

---

**Scene 3: Solving the Case**

They've collected 8 clues. Each was a Math problem. They didn't notice.

Final quiz: 5 PSLE-format questions. Same style they'll see in the actual exam.

If they get it right → **CASE SOLVED.** Animation reveals the culprit.

If they get it wrong → They can review their work, see where logic broke down, try again.

---

**That's the difference.**

Not "learning Math." 
**Using Math.**

---

### What Students Actually Do:
1. **Explore** → Click around scenes (classroom, canteen, library) to find clues
2. **Collect** → Evidence = Math problems disguised as receipts, schedules, measurements
3. **Interview** → Read witness statements (English comprehension naturally embedded)
4. **Analyze** → Every clue needs Math to decode (fractions, time, money, measurement)
5. **Solve** → Final quiz = PSLE-format questions that crack the case
6. **Progress** → Unlock next mystery

---

## The Addictive Part (Gacha Game Psychology)

**Why kids can't stop playing:**

### 1. Mystery Boxes (Gacha Mechanic)
- Solve a case correctly → earn **Detective Coins**
- Spend coins to open **Mystery Evidence Boxes**
- Random rewards: rare detective badges, character avatars, case file skins
- **Rare drops:** "Golden Detective Badge" (0.5% drop rate) - kids will grind for this
- Collection gallery: "You have 23/50 badges. Missing: Legendary Sleuth Star"

### 2. Daily Streaks (Habit Formation)
- **Day 1:** Solve 1 problem → +10 coins
- **Day 7:** +100 coins bonus + special "Week Warrior" badge
- **Day 30:** Unlock exclusive "Master Detective" avatar
- Miss a day → streak resets → kids log in daily to not lose progress

### 3. Leaderboards (Competition)
- **School Leaderboard:** Top 10 detectives displayed in lobby
- **National Leaderboard:** Top 100 students across Singapore
- **Weekly Challenges:** "Fastest case solver this week wins $50 voucher"
- **Class vs Class:** Which class solves most cases this month?

### 4. Limited-Time Events (FOMO)
- **Weekend Mystery:** Special case only available Sat-Sun → "Solve it or miss forever"
- **Seasonal Cases:** CNY Detective Case (Feb), National Day Mystery (Aug)
- **Flash Challenges:** "Next 2 hours: Double coins for all solves!"

### 5. Cash Prizes (Real Stakes)
- **Monthly Top Detective:** $100 cash prize to #1 student
- **School Challenge:** Top school wins $500 book vouchers
- **Perfect Score Club:** Solve 10 cases with 100% → enter lucky draw for $1000
- **Referral Rewards:** Invite friend who completes 3 cases → both get $10 voucher

### 6. Progressive Unlocks (Always One More Thing)
- Start with 1 detective avatar → unlock 50 more by playing
- Basic case file design → earn rare holographic skins
- **"Just one more case to unlock the golden badge..."** ← This keeps them playing

### 7. Social Proof (Peer Pressure)
- "Sarah just solved Case #5 in 12 minutes!" (notifications)
- "Your classmate unlocked the Rare Magnifying Glass!" 
- Share achievements to WhatsApp: "I'm Top 3 Detective in my school 🔍"

---

**The Psychology:**
- **Variable rewards** (mystery boxes) = slot machine effect
- **Daily streaks** = Duolingo-style habit formation
- **Leaderboards** = competitive kids can't resist
- **Cash prizes** = parents support it ("you can earn money learning Math!")
- **FOMO events** = kids check in frequently
- **Collection mechanics** = "gotta catch 'em all" from Pokemon

**Ethical Balance:**
- No pay-to-win (can't buy coins with money)
- Rewards earned only through solving Math correctly
- Prizes capped (not gambling, just incentives)
- Parents can disable leaderboards if desired

### Prize Pool Strategy (How to Fund $1000s in Rewards)

**Revenue from Schools:**
- School pays $500/year → supports 100 students
- $5 per student/year
- Allocate 20% to prize pool = $1 per student = $100 prize budget per school

**If 10 schools (1000 students):**
- Revenue: $5,000/year
- Prize pool: $1,000/year
- Monthly top detective: $50 x 12 = $600
- Quarterly school challenge: $100 x 4 = $400
- Leaves budget for mystery boxes (digital rewards = $0 cost)

**Sponsors (Future):**
- Popular bookstores: "Top detective wins $200 at Kinokuniya"
- EdTech partners: "Win a tablet for perfect scores"
- This offloads prize costs once you have traction

**Free Tier (B2C Parents):**
- Kids can play for free but no cash prizes (only badges/avatars)
- Want to compete for cash? → Parent pays $5/month to enter prize pool
- Or school subscribes and all students auto-eligible

### 2.2 Educational Strategy

**MOE Syllabus Implementation (How to Actually Build This):**

**Step 1: Download Official MOE Resources (Free)**
- MOE Primary Math Syllabus 2021 (free PDF from MOE website)
- PSLE Math past year papers (free from SEAB)
- MOE Maths textbooks (borrow from library or buy used for $10)
- Note down learning objectives for P4/P5/P6

**Step 2: Map Detective Story to Learning Objectives**
- Example: P5 Learning Objective = "Solve word problems involving fractions"
- Detective Case: "Missing Canteen Money" 
  - Clue 1: Receipt shows "3/4 of students bought lunch" → calculate number of students
  - Clue 2: "Thief took 2/3 of the money" → calculate stolen amount
  - Witness: "I saw someone at 2:45pm" → timeline fraction problem
- Each clue = 1 MOE learning objective practiced

**Step 3: Use ACTUAL PSLE Questions in Quiz**
- Don't reinvent the wheel - use past PSLE questions (copyright free after 2 years)
- Modify numbers/names to fit detective story context
- Keep question format EXACTLY like PSLE (2 marks MCQ, 4 marks structured)

**Step 4: AI-Accelerated Implementation**

**Technical Stack (All Free):**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 + React + TypeScript (Cursor/GitHub Copilot helps code)
- **Backend:** Supabase (auth + PostgreSQL + real-time)
- **Images:** Multi-tool approach - ChatGPT DALL-E 3, Midjourney free trial, Leonardo.ai
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui (free, copy-paste), Tailwind CSS
- **AI Coding Assistants:** Cursor (free trial), GitHub Copilot (free for students), or ChatGPT to debug

**AI-Powered Content Workflow:**
1. **Story Writing:**
   - ChatGPT: "Write a detective story for 10-year-olds about missing canteen money"
   - Generate 5 variations → pick best → refine with Singapore context
   - Add Math clues: "How can I embed fraction problems into this receipt clue?"
   
2. **Visual Assets:**
   - Generate 20+ background options: "Singapore primary school classroom, mystery atmosphere, cartoon style, bright colors"
   - Character consistency: Save best prompt, reuse for all character images
   - Evidence items: "receipt with numbers for math problem, photographed from above, clear lighting" → generate 10, pick clearest
   
3. **Quiz Questions:**
   - Start with PSLE question (e.g., "John bought 3/4 kg of apples...")
   - Claude: "Rewrite this in detective context: suspect bought fruit from canteen"
   - Verify answer accuracy yourself (don't trust AI math)
   
4. **Code Development:**
   - Use AI to generate boilerplate: "Create React component for detective scene with click-to-reveal clues"
   - You write game logic (AI assists with syntax/debugging)
   - AI writes test cases, documentation

**Quality Control (Critical):**
- AI generates content → YOU validate accuracy (especially Math answers)
- Regenerate until quality matches paid alternatives
- Test with real kids, iterate based on feedback
- Effort = your competitive advantage (no money = more time investment)

**Engagement Hooks:**
- Mystery narrative creates curiosity and sustained attention
- Interactive elements (not passive reading)
- Immediate feedback on clue discoveries
- Progress tracking and achievement system
- Safe failure environment (can replay cases)

**Differentiation:**
- Three difficulty levels per grade (P4 Easy/Medium/Hard, etc.)
- Optional AI hint system (future Phase 2 feature)
- Teachers assign cases based on student ability
- Can replay cases for mastery learning

### Ethical Gamification (Important)

**What we're doing:**
- Using game mechanics to make Math practice addictive (leaderboards, streaks, gacha)
- Borrowing from mobile games (mystery boxes, collections, FOMO, variable rewards)
- Cash prizes to incentivize learning (kids can earn money solving PSLE Math)

**What we're NOT doing:**
- Pay-to-win (can't buy coins or badges with money)
- Infinite grinding (daily caps on coins earned)
- Predatory loot boxes (no money spent on gacha, only time/effort)
- Ignoring learning outcomes (rewards only for correct Math)
- Hidden mechanics (transparent drop rates, parent visibility)

**Parent Controls Built-In:**
- Disable leaderboards (if competition causes stress)
- Opt out of cash prizes (if ethically uncomfortable)
- View all time spent + cases solved (full transparency)
- Cap daily usage (prevent 5-hour grinding sessions)

**The Balance:**
Use addiction psychology for **good** (learning Math) not **harm** (gambling/exploitation). Every reward requires mastering PSLE syllabus.

**Philosophical Question:**
*Is it ethical to make learning addictive?*

Our answer: **Yes, if done transparently.** Better kids are addicted to Math practice than TikTok/YouTube. Parents have full control to disable any feature.

- AI-generate 50+ badge designs (Common, Rare, Legendary tiers)
- Test cash prize messaging (do parents approve or find it inappropriate?)
- Deploy on Vercel free tier
- Create demo video showcasing:
  - Mystery box opening animation (dopamine hit)
  - Leaderboard climb (competition)
  - Daily streak milestone (habit)
- Write pitch email emphasizing "students voluntarily do extra practice"

**AI-Powered MVP = Professional quality, zero cost, pure effort investment**

---

## What Happens Next

### Month 1-4: Build the First Case
- Create one detective story so good kids tell their friends about it
- Every clue is a real P5 Math problem from MOE syllabus
- AI-generated visuals (iterate 100+ times until it feels right)
- Test with real kids, watch their faces, iterate

### Month 5-6: The Quiet Launch
- Deploy it. Let it exist.
- Share with 10 teachers via personal message (not mass email)
- Message: *"Built something. Curious if it works. Want to see?"*
- Watch what happens:
  - If teachers forward it to colleagues → you're onto something
  - If kids ask "when's the next case?" → you've got product-market fit
  - If silence → either messaging wrong or product wrong, investigate

**Month 6 Gut Check:**
- ✅ **Green:** 1 teacher using regularly, students engaged → build Case 2
- ⚠️ **Yellow:** Teachers interested but students don't engage → fix gameplay
- ❌ **Red:** Nobody cares → stop or completely rethink

---

*Total Investment: Zero dollars. 200-300 hours. One bet that learning can feel different.*

---

### Month 7-12: If It's Working
- Email 100 schools with free trial offer (personalized emails, not mass blast)
- Target smaller neighborhood schools (less bureaucracy than top schools)
- Offer FREE forever for first 3 schools (desperate for testimonials)
- If NO responses by Month 6 → product is wrong, pivot or stop
- If 1 school says yes → work directly with that teacher, iterate weekly
- Do NOT build more cases until first school proves students use it
- **Conservative Reality:** You might get ZERO responses. Be ready to stop.

### Month 7-12: If It's Working
- Build 3 more Math cases (total 4 cases covering P4-P6)
- Reach 3-5 schools organically (word of mouth, teacher referrals)
- Add Science case (1-2 mysteries) if schools ask for it
- Simple parent view (see their kid's progress)
- Document what's working, what's not (honest case study, not marketing fluff)
- **Reality Check:** Focus on proving value with pilot schools before scaling aggressively

### For MOE (Eventually - Year 3)

*Not a pitch. A conversation.*

If this works — if 5 schools use it for a year, if learning data shows improvement, if teachers say "this actually helps" — then maybe it's worth showing MOE.

Not to sell. To share.

*"We tried something different. Here's what happened. Thought you'd want to know."*

### Year 2: Decision Gate - Scale or Stop

**Success Criteria (continue B2B):**
- ✅ 5+ paying schools ($1,500+ MRR)
- ✅ 60%+ school renewal rate
- ✅ NPS >30 from teachers
- ✅ Measurable learning gains (5%+ improvement)
- ✅ **High engagement signals:**
  - 70%+ students log in 3+ times per week
  - 50%+ maintain daily streaks >7 days
  - Students voluntarily solve extra cases (beyond teacher requirements)
  - Kids check leaderboards multiple times per session
  - Mystery box open rate >80% (they're hooked on rewards)
- **Action:** Raise funding or continue bootstrapping, hire content team

**Pivot Criteria (try B2C):**
- ⚠️ Only 1-3 paying schools after 18 months

---

## For Schools

*"What if students competed to do MORE Math homework?"*

We're creating something different. Not another drill app. Not more worksheets.

Kids become detectives. Every Math problem is a clue. Solve cases → earn coins → open mystery boxes → unlock rare badges → climb leaderboard → win cash prizes.

**Your students will:**
- Check leaderboards daily ("Am I still Top 5?")
- Log in for daily streaks ("Can't break my 12-day streak!")
- Ask for extra cases ("Can I solve another one?")
- Compete for school's monthly $50 prize
- Practice Math voluntarily (for coins and legendary badges)

**Bonus for schools:**
- Top school in nation wins $500 book vouchers
- Class vs class competitions (built-in motivation)
- Teachers can see who's grinding vs who needs help

**The test:**
One teacher. One class. Two weeks. See if they stop talking about it.

*(No contracts. No setup fees. If students aren't obsessed by Week 2, we failed.)*

---

## For Parents (If School Path Doesn't Work)

*"Your kid just spent 45 minutes on Math. Willingly. Without being asked."*

No nagging. No tears. No 'just 5 more questions.'

They're solving mysteries. Earning coins. Opening mystery boxes (gacha-style). Competing with friends. Maintaining daily streaks.

And every single reward requires solving PSLE Math correctly.

**The hook:** Top students win cash prizes monthly. Your kid can literally earn $100 doing Math homework.

**Parent control:** You can disable leaderboards/prizes if you want pure learning without competition.

Free to try (badges only). $5/month to enter national prize pool.

*PS: Cheaper than tuition, more addictive than mobile games, actually teaches PSLE syllabus.*
- ⚠️ Parents keep asking "can I buy this for home use?"
- **Action:** Launch parent subscription ($5/month), test Facebook/Instagram ads with curiosity-driven content

**B2C Marketing (AI-Powered, Intriguing Not Pushy):**
- Video: Kid's face lighting up solving a case (parent films on phone, authentic moment)
- Instagram: "She did fractions for 30 minutes and didn't notice" (testimonial, not ad)
- Facebook: "Why are PSLE parents talking about this game?" (spark curiosity)
- Landing page: Minimalist - headline, 30-sec demo video, "Try Free" button (no walls of features)
- Measurement: If free users don't return Day 2 → product or messaging is wrong

---

---

## The Question

*What if every kid discovered they were good at Math?*

Not because they drilled harder.

Because for 45 minutes, they forgot it was Math.

They were just solving a mystery.

---

**Detective Sigma**

*Coming 2026. Built in Singapore, for Singapore students.*

---

**If you're a teacher who's curious:** [your email here]

**If you're building this:** 
- Status: Development (Dec 2025)
- Launch: Q2 2026
- Investment: $0 money, 200-300 hours effort
- Goal: Make 1 teacher say "my students won't stop talking about this"

---

*Think Different* — but for Math homework.
- ⚠️ Schools like product but won't pay
- ⚠️ Parents asking for direct access
- **Action:** Launch parent subscriptions ($5-10/month), market via social media

**Kill Criteria (shut down):**
- ❌ Zero paying customers by Month 18
- ❌ Can't prove any learning impact
- ❌ Students don't use it even when free
- ❌ Burn rate >$3K/month with no revenue
- **Action:** Open-source the code, write post-mortem, move on

---

## 7. Success Metrics

**Educational Impact (pilot targets):**
- 5-10% improvement in Math problem-solving scores (pre/post test)
- Students spend 15-20 mins avg per case (vs 5 mins on worksheets)
- 50%+ case completion rate (realistic for voluntary use)
- 3.5/5 teacher satisfaction (expect critical feedback initially)
- **Measurement:** Pre/post tests, usage analytics, teacher surveys (not claims)

**Business Metrics:**
- Year 1: 2-5 pilot schools, 100-300 students (prove value)
- Year 2: 10-20 schools, 600-1,200 students (if pilot succeeds)
- Year 3: 30-50 schools, 2,000-3,000 students (sustainable growth)
- **Reality Check:** EdTech school sales are slow; focus on retention over acquisition

**User Experience (targets to iterate toward):**
- Average case completion time: 20-30 minutes (adjust based on data)
- 40-60% case completion rate (dropout is normal in EdTech)
- 3.5-4.0/5 student enjoyment rating (realistic for "educational" game)
- Measure and iterate - don't assume high engagement

- Note: Can run entire pilot (500-1000 students) on FREE tier indefinitely

**Funding Strategy (AI-Enabled Zero Budget):**
- **Startup SG Founder:** Apply after traction (need 6 months operations + revenue)
- **Personal Investment:** $0 cash (pure time investment - 200-300 hours)
- **AI = Your Unfair Advantage:** 
  - What cost $50K in 2020 (designers, writers, developers) now costs $0 + effort in 2025
  - Professional-grade content possible without capital
  - Your willingness to work hard = competitive moat
- **Revenue-First:** Get 1 paying school BEFORE any spending
- **Grants:** Apply Year 2 after proving model works

**Conservative Execution:**
1. Build 1 high-quality case using AI tools (Month 1-3) - $0 cost
2. Deploy on Vercel free tier (5 minutes setup) - $0 cost
3. Get 1 school to trial for FREE (Month 4-5)
4. If they love it → charge $200-300 for full year (Month 6)
5. Use first revenue ONLY if needed (custom domain: $15, or save for ACRA: $300)
6. Reinvest time (not money) to build Case 2 using AI - $0 cost
7. Repeat until 5 cases → then pitch to more schools
8. Can serve 500-1000 students on free tier indefinitely

**AI Changes Everything:**
- 2020: Need $50K capital to build MVP
- 2025: Need $0 capital + 300 hours + AI tools = same quality MVP

**Break-Even Scenarios (Zero Budget):**
- **Best case:** 3 schools @ $300 = $900/year by Month 12 (pure profit - no hosting costs!)
- **Realistic:** 1 school @ $200 = $200/year (100% profit since Vercel is free)
- **Worst case:** Zero revenue by Month 12 → Total loss = your TIME only (literally $0 spent)
- **Key insight:** With Vercel free tier, first dollar earned = first dollar profit (no operating costs)

**When to Quit:**
- If Month 6: No school trials → Stop, idea doesn't resonate
- If Month 12: Zero paying schools → Stop, not a viable business
- If Month 18: 1 paying school only → Keep as side project, don't quit day job
- If Year 2: 5+ schools → Consider full-time if you want

**Personal Financial Reality (Zero-Capital Advantage):**
- **NEVER quit day job** - this is a nights/weekends side project ONLY
- Spend ZERO money period - Vercel free tier means no hosting/infrastructure costs ever
- OPTIONAL spending: Custom domain ($15) or ACRA registration ($300) only if school requires
- Set time budget: 10-15 hours/week (sustainable long-term)
- If Month 12 = no traction → stop, don't waste more time
- **Risk profile:** Zero financial risk (only time invested), max upside if it works
- Conservative mindset: Assume this will fail, but failure costs nothing except your time

## 9. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Worst Case |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Schools don't adopt at all | High | **High** | Free pilot, pivot to parents | Shut down by Month 18, loss of TIME only ($0 spent) |
| Only 1-2 schools sign up | High | Medium | Lower price to $200-300, add features | Pivot to B2C or stop |
| Students don't engage (boring) | High | Medium | UX testing with real kids, iterate fast | Platform fails, salvage code for other projects |
| Can't prove learning gains | High | Medium | Rigorous pre/post testing, lower claims | Reposition as "engagement tool" not "learning tool" |
| Content creation too slow | Medium | Medium | AI acceleration, iterate 10x per case | Launch with 1-2 quality cases vs 10 mediocre ones |
| Competitors copy idea | Medium | Low | Speed to market, relationships with schools | Compete on execution, not idea |
| Vercel free tier limits exceeded | Low | Low | Monitor usage, upgrade to Pro ($20/mo) only if needed | Pay $20/month from first revenue if 1000+ students |
| Legal/PDPA issues | High | Low | Use AI-generated templates, optional lawyer review ($500) | Shut down immediately if non-compliant |

## 10. Why Now?

**Market Timing:**
- Post-COVID push for digital learning tools
- MOE Smart Nation Education Initiative (2025-2030)
- Parents increasingly tech-savvy and willing to adopt EdTech
- PSLE pressure drives demand for effective prep tools

**Technical Maturity:**
- Vercel free tier now sufficient for 1,000+ users (complete hosting + database + CDN = $0)
- AI tutoring (Google Gemini) available at $0 cost for education
- AI content generation (ChatGPT, DALL-E, Claude) enables professional-quality MVP at zero cost
- Next.js 14 and Vercel deployment enable 5-minute setup (git push = live production)

**Competitive Reality:**
- **Truth:** Koobits, Geniebook already dominate school market ($20M+ funding)
- **Truth:** Schools resist new tools (change management, training time)
- **Truth:** "Detective theme" might not be enough differentiation
- **Our bet:** Narrative-driven engagement will work better than gamification points
- **Our edge:** We're nimble, can customize for schools, direct relationship with HODs
- **Our weakness:** No brand, no funding, no track record
- **Honest assessment:** This is a long-shot. Most EdTech startups fail. We need luck + execution.

## 11. Call to Action

**For Schools:**

*"What if Math homework felt like a mystery they couldn't stop solving?"*

We're creating something different. Not another drill app. Not more worksheets.

Kids become detectives. Every Math problem is a clue. Every correct answer reveals part of the story.

One teacher. One class. Two weeks. See what happens.

*(No contracts. No setup fees. Just curious to see if it works.)*

**For MOE (Eventually):**

*Not a pitch. A conversation.*

If this works — if 5 schools use it for a year, if learning data shows improvement, if teachers say "this actually helps" — then maybe it's worth showing MOE.

Not to sell. To share.

*"We tried something different. Here's what happened. Thought you'd want to know."*

Year 3. Maybe. If we're still here.

**For Investors:**
Not seeking investment. Bootstrapping with $0. Will consider raising money only after:
- 10+ paying schools
- Proven 5%+ learning improvement
- $2K+ monthly revenue

Until then: self-funded (time only), no dilution, no investors.

## 12. Backup Plan: B2C Pivot (If Schools Don't Adopt)

**If schools reject after 12-18 months, pivot to parents:**

**For Parents (If School Path Doesn't Work):**

*"Your kid just spent 45 minutes on Math. Willingly. Without being asked."*

No nagging. No tears. No 'just 5 more questions.'

They're solving a mystery. Math is how they crack the case.

Free to try. $5/month if they can't stop playing.

---

**B2C Marketing Strategy (AI-Powered, Zero Cost):**
- **Content Theme:** Show, don't sell
  - Video: Kid's face lighting up when clue reveals (parent films on phone)
  - Instagram: "She did fractions for 30 minutes and didn't notice" (testimonial style)
  - Facebook: "What game are PSLE parents talking about?" (curiosity-driven)
- **Distribution:** Parent groups, Reddit r/singapore, HardwareZone (seed authentic conversations)
- **Landing Page:** Minimalist - headline, 30-sec demo video, "Try Free" button (no walls of text)
- **AI Execution:** ChatGPT writes 10 variations, you A/B test, keep best performing
- **Measurement:** If free users don't return Day 2 → messaging wrong or product wrong

**Why parents might buy even if schools don't:**
- Parents pay for tuition; schools have budget constraints
- Parents want PSLE prep; schools need curriculum alignment
- Direct payment removes procurement friction

**B2C Reality Check:**
- CAC likely $20-50 (Facebook ads)
- Need 100 paying parents to break even ($800 MRR)
- Churn likely 30-50% (subscription fatigue)
- Easier to test than school sales (faster feedback loop)

**Hybrid Approach (Month 6-12):**
- Run school pilots AND test B2C in parallel
- If parents convert better, pivot fully to B2C
- If schools convert better, double down on B2B
- Don't be dogmatic about "which customer is right"
